What.is.Synote.desc1=Synote makes multimedia resources such as video and audio easier to access, search, manage, and exploit. Learners, teachers and other users can create notes, bookmarks, tags, links, images and text captions synchronised to any part of a recording, such as a lecture.
What.is.Synote.desc2=Imagine how difficult it would be to use a textbook if it had no contents page, index or page numbers. Synote actually provides the way to find or associate notes with a particular part of a recording,i.e. the media fragments.

Let.Google.Index.Your.Media.Fragment=Let Google Index Your Media Fragment
Let.Google.Index.Your.Media.Fragment.desc=Media fragment is important on the Web as it describes the inside content of multimedia resource. Major search engines, however, are not able to index media fragments and the related annotations. We analysed this problem from both multimedia application and search engine's point of views. The key problem is that media fragments and annotations do not have their own page on the Web and they share the same page as the parent resource. Our solution is using Google Ajax Application Crawler and server-side programmes to create snapshot pages for each media fragment and related annotations. In this way, media fragments will have their own links in the search results and on following the links, users still visit the same replay page as before. We have tested the implementation and the result shows that the media fragments could be indexed by Google

Publishing.Media.Fragments.and.Annotations.as.Linked.Data=Publishing Media Fragments and Annotations as Linked Data
Publishing.Media.Fragments.and.Annotations.as.Linked.Data.desc=While end users could easily share and tag the multimedia resources online, the searching and reusing of the inside content of multimedia is still difficult. Many applications in Web 2.0 have generated many external annotations linked to media fragments. This video use Synote as the target application to discuss how media fragments could be published together with external annotations following linked data principles. We also implement a model to let Google index media fragments which improves the online presence of media fragments.We hope that more media fragments could be published later to benefit the indexing of multimedia resources.
