<h1><b>Synote Accessibility Document</b></h1>
<p>We would like to make Synote as accessible and as usable as

<h2>Some suggestions to help deaf or hearing impaired users:</h2>
- Provide a synchronised text transcription.<br />
- Provide additional information in the Synmark about sounds or tone of
voice or emotions that are conveyed by the audio but not the text
transcription.<br />
- Provide a Sign Language translation either in the video or by using
the Synmarks (i.e. by linking to or embedding sign language videos)<br />
<br />
<h2>Some suggestions to help blind or visually impaired users:</h2>
- Provide text or audio descriptions (i.e. by linking to or embedding a
recording) of any important visual information using Synmarks.<br />
- Synote can be used as a 'talking book' by synchronising a spoken
recording with the text and using the Synmarks to provide a contents
list, section heading and/or index.<br />
- Using the print option is one way to allow blind or visually impaired
users to access all the text information available on Synote.<br />
